# SIMSHELL

**SimShell** is a modular and lightweight framework for building menu-driven simulation games ‚Äî games without traditional world maps, controlled entirely through menus, buttons, and tabs.

The framework is written in Python and provides UI lifecycle management, input handling, and the foundation for all other modules.

---

## üéØ Project Goals

- Provide essential UI components tailored for stat-based and turn-based simulation games.
- Encourage clean modularity and minimal coupling.
- Be easy to extend and maintain, even for beginner developers.
- Serve as a personal learning project for game framework design.

---

## üìö Project Documentation

All core documentation is maintained in the `/docs` folder:

- [Project Roadmap](docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md): Development phases, milestones, and detailed implementation goals.
- [MVP Compliance Checklist](docs/MVP_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md): Rules and criteria for what the MVP must fulfill.
- [Developer Commitment & Guidelines](docs/DEVELOPER_COMMITMENT.md): Principles to ensure modular, understandable, and testable development.
- [Test Template & Strategy](docs/TESTS_TEMPLATE.md): Patterns and conventions for writing unit and integration tests.
- [Commit Guidlines](docs/COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md): Formats and Best Practices for writing commits in this project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The project is currently in the early conceptual and documentation phase. There is no working code yet ‚Äî development will start after the MVP structure and technical decisions finalized.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pappet/NoMapNeeded.git
cd NoMapNeeded
```

### 2. Build the Framework

[TODO]

## üí° Design Philosophy

NoMapNeeded is designed around the following principles:

- **Modularity First**: Each module has one responsibility and interacts via clean interfaces.
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI elements trigger events ‚Äî game logic handles consequences.
- **Learning-Driven Development**: Simplicity, readability, and documentation are favored over cleverness.
- **Retained-Mode UI**: UI components persist and are only updated on demand.

## üë• Contributing

Contributions, feedback, and learning input are welcome ‚Äî especially from other Zig learners! Please make sure to follow the principles outlined in the [Developer Commitment](docs/DEVELOPER_COMMITMENT.md).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This framework is being developed as a personal learning project with the active assistance of OpenAI's ChatGPT for guidance and architectural decisions.

The project is intentionally simple and handcrafted to foster understanding ‚Äî production use is possible but not the primary goal.
