# SimShell ‚Äì Project Roadmap (Detailed)

This roadmap defines the development phases, key milestones, and structural goals of the SimShell framework. Each phase builds upon the previous one and has clear learning, implementation, and structural objectives to ensure modularity, maintainability, and developer understanding.

---

## REMEMBER:
- **Each module must be isolated and responsible for a single concern.**
- **No direct dependency between UI modules and Game Logic modules.**
- **All module APIs must be simple, documented, and testable.**

---

## üöÄ Phase 1 ‚Äì MVP (Minimal Viable Product)

### Objective:
Build the minimal working version of the framework, including basic UI components, simulation logic, and a working event-driven architecture.

### Deliverables:

#### Core (SimShell)
- Event loop and application window (via pygame)
- Input handling (mouse clicks, keyboard)
- Event dispatch system
- Basic lifecycle management (init, update, shutdown)

#### UI Components
- **Button:** Displays text and triggers an event when clicked
- **Label:** Displays static text
- **Panel:** Container for other UI elements
- **Layout system:** Simple grid/row/column positioning system

#### Gameplay Modules
- **Stats System:** Defines and stores player stats (fatigue, money, time)
- **Time System:** Time passes when actions are performed

#### Integration
- Basic **Tab system**: Ability to switch between different views/screens
- Simple event system connecting UI and game logic

#### Documentation & Tests
- MVP Compliance Checklist fulfilled
- Developer Commitment adhered to
- At least one example game using all MVP features
- Lessons Learned file after MVP completion

### Learning Goals:
- Modular architecture in Python
- Event-driven systems
- Separation of concerns (UI vs. Game Logic)
- Basic retained-mode UI principles

## üî• Phase 2 ‚Äì Core Extensions & Quality

### Objective:
Extend the framework with essential comfort features and improve internal quality.

### Deliverables:

#### UI Enhancements
- **Scrollable lists** for dynamic UI content
- **Focus handling:** Keyboard navigation & input focus management
- Extended layout options (alignment, dynamic sizes)

#### Game Logic Enhancements
- **Save/Load system:** Serialize and restore game state
- **Event Log:** UI element displaying past events and actions
- **Multi-stage events:** Random encounters, chained events with multiple outcomes

#### Quality Improvements
- Full unit test coverage for all modules
- Basic integration tests
- Updated developer guidelines and documentation

### Learning Goals:
- Advanced module communication patterns
- Persistent state handling
- Complex event management

---

## üåü Phase 3 ‚Äì Comfort & Advanced Features

### Objective:
Enhance developer experience and usability features.

### Deliverables:

#### UI Enhancements
- **Theme/Style system:** Centralized configuration of colors, fonts, spacing
- **Improved layout flexibility:** Responsive behavior, relative sizing
- **Modal dialogs and confirmation windows**

#### Development Comfort
- In-game **console** for debugging and command input
- Extended integration tests and behavior tests
- Sample game scenario using Phase 2 & 3 features

### Learning Goals:
- UI theming and styling
- Test strategies for large-scale frameworks
- Real-time debugging tools

---

## üîÆ Phase 4 ‚Äì Plugins & Scripting

### Objective:
Enable external extension of the framework by other developers.

### Deliverables:

#### Plugin System
- API to register new UI elements, stats, and events
- Dynamic module loading (optional, if technically feasible in Python)

#### Scripting Support
- Lightweight scripting interface (custom DSL or existing scripting language)
- Hooks for adding scripted game logic and events

#### Developer Support
- Clear documentation for plugin API
- Example plugin project
- Mod-friendly project structure

### Learning Goals:
- API design for third-party extensions
- Safe and clean dynamic content integration
- Modular architecture for large-scale content

---

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Final Goal

The framework is considered **feature complete** when:

- All four phases are implemented and documented
- The entire framework is fully tested
- An example simulation game demonstrates all major features
- Documentation allows external developers to use and extend the framework without deep knowledge of the internals
- I can confidently explain every part of the framework and its architecture

## üìÑ Next Steps

1. Complete MVP features and checklist
2. Write Lessons Learned after MVP
3. Review Project Structure Guidelines regularly
4. Proceed to Phase 2 development after MVP validation
